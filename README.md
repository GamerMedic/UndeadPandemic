# UndeadPandemic Wiki

## Getting Started!

Getting set up with UndeadPandemic is quick and easy.

The plugin can be played 'out of the box', meaning that as soon as you install it on your server, your players will experience what it's like to survive within a post-apocalyptic world where Zombies have inherited the Earth.

### Installation

1. [Download UndeadPandemic from Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/undeadpandemic.95385/).
2. Place the UndeadPandemic.jar file into your `/plugins` server folder.
3. Restart your server.

That's it!

The config.yml file is already configured in a way that will allow you to survive through a Zombie apocalypse without affecting vanilla gameplay too much.

The UndeadPandemic plugin is highly configurable though, and you can set it up to work however you'd like.
