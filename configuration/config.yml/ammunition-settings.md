# Ammunition Settings

Ammunition settings create the ammo types within the game.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**TIP**_: It is possible to create your own ammunition! See the '[Custom Ammunition](../../items/custom-ammunition.md)' section for instructions.
{% endhint %}

**`ammoName`**:

This is the ID of the ammunition that will appear in the tab-complete list when writing out the command. This corresponds to the weapon type settings and is case-senstitive. If the weapon type setting does not match this setting, then the gun will not fire.

**`name`**:

This will set your display name for the ammunition.

**`lore`**:

This will set the lore for the ammunition.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**TIP**_: Minecraft colours can be used in the name and lore.
{% endhint %}

**`custom_model_data`**:

All ammunition uses the Snowball as the Projectile. However, you can style the Snowball however you'd like using custom model data within your resource pack.
