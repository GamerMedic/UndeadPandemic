# Barbed Wire Settings

This configuration section is very simple.

**`enabled`**:

Should barbed wire (cobwebs) hurt players when they walk into the wire?

`true|false`

This is true by default.

**`damage`**:

This option can be set between 0 - 40, and this represents the number of hearts that a player has.

20 is full health, and 1 is half a heart. You can set this value up to 40 so that you can also damage armour.

`damage` is set to 2 (one heart) by default.
