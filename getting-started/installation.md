# âž• Installation

1. [Download UndeadPandemic from Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/undeadpandemic) or [GitHub](https://github.com/GamerMedic/UndeadPandemic/releases).
2. Place the UndeadPandemic.jar file into your `/plugins` server folder.
3. Download [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) and an [Economy plugin](https://modrinth.com/plugins?f=categories:economy) and add then to your `/plugins` server folder.
4. Restart your server.

That's it!

The `config.yml` file is already configured in a way that will allow you to survive through a Zombie apocalypse without affecting vanilla gameplay too much.

The UndeadPandemic plugin is highly configurable though, and you can set it up to work however you'd like.

You can download the PAPI expansion from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/undeadpandemic-papi-expansion.97079/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/GamerMedic/UndeadPandemic).
