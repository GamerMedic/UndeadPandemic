# âž• Installation

1. [Download UndeadPandemic from Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/undeadpandemic.95385/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/GamerMedic/UndeadPandemic/releases).
2. Place the UndeadPandemic.jar file into your `/plugins` server folder.
3. Restart your server.

That's it!

The `config.yml` file is already configured in a way that will allow you to survive through a Zombie apocalypse without affecting vanilla gameplay too much.

The UndeadPandemic plugin is highly configurable though, and you can set it up to work however you'd like.

### Placeholder API

You can download the PAPI expansion from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/undeadpandemic-papi-expansion.97079/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/GamerMedic/UndeadPandemic).
