# ðŸŒ‘ Blood Moon

There's something special about a full moon isn't there?

If you ask any member of the emergency services or healthcare sector they'll tell you that the crazys come out during the full moon.

There's some truth to that, or so there seems to be anyway. But how does that relate to zombies?

Well, zombies used to be people and they still go bonkers for a full moon.

So every full moon there's a chance, just a chance mind, that the power of the moon will produce a horde not worth fighting. Your best defence? Hide. Or at least get a Gatling Gun.

And once the hordes start, they don't stop until the full moon disappears.

Our advice? Make sure you have a productive farm and strong walls.
