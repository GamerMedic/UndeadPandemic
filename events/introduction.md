# ðŸŽˆ Introduction

Events can be programmable (set up using `config.yml`) or happen when certain conditions are met.

Events are useful tools to add challenges and to offer rewards. They're designed to keep players entertained, and on their toes.

Be careful not to make events too frequent or too rare. You may cause fatigue or boredom amongst players.
