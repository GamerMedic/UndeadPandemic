# ðŸ§Ÿâ™€ Hordes

Hordes. This is the main event whenever a zombie apocalypse happens.

A horde happens when a player stays in the same area for a while. More and more zombies appear and take over an area, causing the player to be overwhelmed.

When enough zombies have congregated in the same area the player will suddenly get a bad feeling. This is only the start. Once a horde has started it causes a surge in one type of zombie.

The zombie type that increases is chosen at random. How much they increase by depends on the `config.yml` configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
Any horde effects only apply to zombies that spawn during a horde. Zombies which existed prior to the start of a horde event are not affected.
{% endhint %}

#### Premium Version Information

Players using the premium version of UndeadPandemic will notice something slightly different. The type of zombie that appears more often is influenced by what biome the player is in.

This is not configurable. But some examples are:

<mark style="color:green;">Slow zombies</mark> appear more often in colder biomes.

<mark style="color:purple;">Strong zombies</mark> appear more often in harsher biomes such as deserts and swamps.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Fast zombies</mark> appear more often in biomes with very few hiding places, such as deserts, plains, and badlands (mesa).

<mark style="color:blue;">Stupid zombies</mark> appear more often in places with a lot of flora, such as mushroom islands and jungles.
