# ðŸ”‹ Batteries

### Description

Batteries enable players to continue using a torch.

### What Do batteries do?

Batteries allow a player to recharge a torch, enabling them to keep a torch for a long time.

### How are batteries obtained?

Batteries can only be given using the [`/undeadpandemic give`](../../commands/undeadpandemic/give/) command. This means that server admins can decide how many batteries are in the game.

(Future versions will included craftable batteries).

{% hint style="success" %}
Batteries are craftable from v3.0.0 using custom recipes.
{% endhint %}

### Modifying the Battery

Batteries can be modified in the `config.yml` file. The name, lore, material, and custom model data can be modified.
