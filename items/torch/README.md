### Description

Using a torch will temporarily give the user the `Night Vision` effect for 1 second per battery life.

Battery life is randomly generated when the torch is created.

### What does the Torch do?

The torch allows a player to see in the dark. It applies the night vision effect for pre-determined amount of time. A torch **must** have battery life to work.

### How is a Torch obtained?

A torch can only be given using the [`/undeadpandemic give`](../../commands/undeadpandemic/give/) command. This means that server admins can decide how many torches are in the game.

(Future versions will included craftable torches).

### Modifying the Torch

The torch can be modified in the `config.yml` file. This includes the duration (in seconds) that the night vision effect is applied per Amp-hour (Ah) of battery life.

The name, lore, material, and custom model data can also be modified.
