### Description

A first aid kit is a bag (chest) full of first aid items.

### Obtaining a First Aid Kit

Players with the [firstaid.give permission](../../permissions/undeadpandemic.firstaid/undeadpandemic.firstaid.give.md) can use the [`give firstaid` command](../../commands/undeadpandemic/give/firstaid.md) to give kits to a player.
