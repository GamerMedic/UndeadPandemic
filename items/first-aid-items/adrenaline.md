### Description

Adrenaline will give life to the player to help them to get to a doctor, or to find a cure for their infection.

Adrenaline will not stop a play from dying of the disease, it merely prolongs death.

### Obtaining Adrenaline

Players with the [firstaid.give permission](../../permissions/permissions/undeadpandemic.firstaid/undeadpandemic.firstaid.give.md) can use the [`give firstaid` command](../../commands/undeadpandemic/give/firstaid.md) to give Adrenaline to a player.

### Using Adrenaline

Adrenaline can be used by players with the [`firstaid.use` permission](../../permissions/permissions/undeadpandemic.firstaid/undeadpandemic.firstaid.use.md) by right-clicking the Adrenaline while holding it.
