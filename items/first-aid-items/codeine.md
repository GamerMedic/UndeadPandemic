### Description

Codeine will take some of the pain away from an infection. It causes health to regenerate slowly over 2 minutes.

### Obtaining Codeine

Players with the [firstaid.give permission](../../permissions/permissions/undeadpandemic.firstaid/undeadpandemic.firstaid.give.md) can use the [`give firstaid` command](../../commands/undeadpandemic/give/firstaid.md) to give Codeine to a player.

Codeine is included in first aid kits.

### Using Codeine

Codeine can be used by players with the [`firstaid.use` permission](../../permissions/permissions/undeadpandemic.firstaid/undeadpandemic.firstaid.use.md) by right-clicking the Codeine while holding it.
