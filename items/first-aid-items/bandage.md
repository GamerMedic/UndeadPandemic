### Description

Bandages will cover wounds and heal them. Bandages will not cure infections, but they will restore a player's health slightly.

### Obtaining a Bandage

Players with the [firstaid.give permission](../../permissions/undeadpandemic.firstaid/undeadpandemic.firstaid.give.md) can use the [`give firstaid` command](../../commands/undeadpandemic/give/firstaid.md) to give bandages to a player.

### Using Bandages

Bandages can be used by players with the [`firstaid.use` permission](../../permissions/undeadpandemic.firstaid/undeadpandemic.firstaid.use.md) by right-clicking the bandage while holding it.
