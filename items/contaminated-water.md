# ðŸš± Contaminated Water

{% hint style="danger" %}
Not yet implemented (as of v2.7.5).

### What is contaminated water?

When you fill a container with water from a body of water (i.e. river, ocean, lake, ect) you will get a `Contaminated Water` item which will look like a normal water bottle.

If the player drinks contaminated water they will become infected.

### How to get drinkable water?

Place [#heat-sources](contaminated-water.md#heat-sources "mention") under a cauldron and fill the cauldron with water. Then collect water from the cauldron as normal.

#### Heat Sources

By default there are 3 valid heat source blocks.

* Magma Block
* Campfire
* Lava

You can add and remove any block(s) that you like. See the [`config settings`](../configuration/config.yml/infected-water-settings.md) for more information.
