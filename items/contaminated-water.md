### What is contaminated water?

When you fill a container with water from a body of water (i.e. river, ocean, lake, ect) you will get a `Contaminated Water` item which will look like a normal water bottle.

If the player drinks contaminated water they will become infected.

### How to get drinkable water?

Place a campfire under a cauldron and fill the cauldron with water. Then collect water from the cauldron as normal.
