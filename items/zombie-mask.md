### Description

### What do Zombie Masks do?

Zombie masks make the player hidden from zombies. They're worn as a hat. Zombie masks have a set durability which reduces over time as the rotting flesh falls away.

Zombie masks wash away completely in rain or when swimming.

Zombie masks can be obtained at random when killing a zombie with a sword.

The [`undeadpandemic.use.zombie`](../permissions/permissions/undeadpandemic.guts/undeadpandemic.guts.use.md) permission is required to use Zombie Masks.
