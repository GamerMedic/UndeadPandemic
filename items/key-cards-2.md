# ğŸ©¸ Zombie Guts

### Description

Zombie guts can be applied to chest plates to hide from zombies.

### What do Zombie Guts do?

A player can apply zombies guts to a chest plate to hide themselves from zombies. The guts are caustic and will damage the chest plate. How much the chest plate is damaged will depend on what the chest plate is made of.

Leather will take the most damage, while netherite will take very little.

The effect of zombie guts will wear off quickly, regardless of chest plate material. And will be instantly removed by water, including rain.

Players need to right-click their chest plate with the guts to apply the guts.

### How are Zombie Masks obtained?

Zombie guts can be obtained by killing zombies. Every zombie death will produce zombie guts.
