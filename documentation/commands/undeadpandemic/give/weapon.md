# ::weapon



The tab-complete will show all of the available weapon types that have been listed in the config.yml file. All you need to do is pick one.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Good to Know**_: This will include any custom weapon types that you have created!
{% endhint %}

Once you've selected a weapon type, you just need to specify how many guns you'd like to give to the player (the "quantity indicator").

{% hint style="warning" %}
**FYI**: You can leave the quantity indicator out of the command. By doing so, you are only giving one bullet to the player.

It's best practice to include the quantity indicator.
