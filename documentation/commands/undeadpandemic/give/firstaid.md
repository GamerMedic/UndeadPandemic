# ::firstaid

The tab-complete will show all of the available first aid items that have been listed in the config.yml file. All you need to do is pick one.

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/give\_cmd\_firstaid\_selector.png)

The `kit` option will give the player one of each first aid item.

First aid items are hard coded and cannot be changed (except for the display options). No custom first aid items can be created.

{% hint style="warning" %}
See 'First Aid Items' to see what each item does.
{% endhint %}

Once you have chosen the desired item, you can enter how many you'd like to give to the player (the "quantity indicator").

{% hint style="warning" %}
**FYI**: You can leave the quantity indicator out of the command. By doing so, you are only giving one of the item to the player.

It's best practice to include the quantity indicator.
{% endhint %}
