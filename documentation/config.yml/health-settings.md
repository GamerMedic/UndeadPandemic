# Health Settings

These settings will determine what items are used as the three health restoring items.

1. _Adrenaline_
2. _Antibiotics_
3. _Bandage_

Each item has the same set up:

**`itemName`**:

This is whatever the item is called, you will be the three items listed above in the default config. Only these three can be used!

**`name`**:

This is the name of the item, this can be anything you want.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**TIP**_: Minecraft colours can be used in the item name and lore.
{% endhint %}

**`lore`**:

This is the lore for the item, again, this can be anything you want.

**`material`**:

This is the Minecraft material that you want to use for the item.

**`data`**:

Data sets the custom model data for the item. You can set this to whatever you want, but it will need to correspond to your resource pack. If you have not set up your own resource pack, then you can use the UndeadPandemic resource pack. Items will be already be set up to work with the config.
