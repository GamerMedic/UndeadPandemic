# 👑 v3.1.0

### Updates

* Added bStats Metrics
* Added metrics charts for common features
* #### **bStats Metrics Tracking Summary**
  * **Vanilla Zombies Spawn Enabled**: Tracks whether vanilla zombies spawn naturally.
  * **Custom Zombie Spawn Rate**: Percentage chance of custom zombies spawning.
  * **Zombie Spawn Rate**: Number of zombies spawned per event.
  * **Zombies Burn in Sunlight**: Whether zombies burn in daylight.
  * **Zombies Pickup Items**: Whether zombies can pick up items.
  * **Zombie Guts Feature Enabled**: Tracks if the Zombie Guts mechanic is active.
  * **Number of Configured Zombie Types**: Counts how many custom zombie types are defined.
  * **Zombie Types Speed Values**: Detailed tracking of movement speed for each zombie type.
  * **Thirst System Enabled**: Whether the thirst mechanic is enabled.
  * **Maximum Thirst Level**: Configured maximum thirst level.
  * **Animal Drops Enabled**: Tracks if animal mobs drop rotten flesh.
  * **Water System Enabled**: Whether the water collection system is active.
  * **Rewards Enabled**: Whether player rewards (money or items) are enabled.
  * **Reward Type**: The type of reward configured (money or item).
  * **Crafting Blacklist Size**: Number of items blacklisted from crafting.
  * **Number of Custom Items**: Counts how many custom items are configured (excluding blacklist).
* Added `Storage` configuration.
  * MySQL
  * SQLite
  * Flatfile (YAML) _<mark style="color:$info;">(Default)</mark>_
* Updated placeholders expansion to make fetching values more reliable.
* Made Thirst references more persistent.
* A missing economy no longer disables the plugin. Instead, rewards will not longer work if no economy is present. Vault is now a soft depend, rather than a requirement.
* Implemented zombie skins so that they can be changed in the `config.yml` file.
  * You can use the keywords '`default`', '`variant`', '`slow`', '`strong`', or '`stupid`' to use the built in skins. Or provide the URL of the skin texture. <mark style="color:$danger;">The server will need to be restarted to apply this change in most cases.</mark>
  * The '`variant`' skin is an alternative normal zombie skin.
* Updated zombie guts so that when trying to place placing zombie guts a block will not be placed. Instead the player will drop the guts to the floor.
* Updated the texture pack to include custom item textures and custom zombie skins unique to UndeadPandemic.
* Updated deprecated code.
* Updated animal mob drops to drop a tainted version of their normal meat drop instead of rotten flesh. The tainted meat cannot be sanitised through cooking and the cooked meat could still infect the player.
* Cleaned unused code.
* Updated custom model data in config and code to match default resource pack CMDs.

### Bug Fixes

* Updated code to include default values for zombies drops to prevent non-fatal errors.
* Fixed bug which prevented config option `zombies.spawn-radius` from working.

### Documentation Updates

* Added v3.1.0 changelog.
* Added Storage Configuration section to `config.yml`.
