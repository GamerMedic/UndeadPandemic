# v2.7.15

**== Bug Fixes ==**

Changes include:

* Replaced 'Safe Zone' text with 'Camp'.
  * Updated language file and camp command.
* Added `enable` option to `rewards` section in `config.yml`. This option will now determine if players receive rewards when killing zombies. This is set to `true` by default.
* Fixed issue preventing milk from curing buffers.
* Added Spanish (`es`) and Chinses (`zh`) translations.
* Added `disable_bossbar` option to the `thirst` section of `config.yml`. Setting this to `true` will prevent the thirst bossbar from loading when a player rejoins. If the boss bar is still visible then use the `/bossbar remove` command.
