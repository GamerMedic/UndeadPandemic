# v2.7.10

**== Bug Fixes ==**

Changes include:

* Fixed typo in default `config.yml` which prevented campfires from working.
  * Change `CAMPIRE` to `CAMPFIRE` in your config.
* Fixed bug which caused all first aid items to be used at the same time if you had multiple.
* Changed name of safezones to camps. Configs still using safezone will still work.
* Updated Camps to ceiling height of 319 for MC versions 1.18 and above, increased from 256.
* Optimised code.
* Fixed bug causing excessive zombies spawns when spawn rate is set to -1.
