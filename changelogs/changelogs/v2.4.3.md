# v2.4.3

_**== Weapons Update ==**_

**Please consider this a Weapons **_**BETA**_** version**.

This update will add support for the [QualityArmory plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quality-armory.47561/) found on Spigot. The QualityArmory plugin weapons will now be the default weapons and will be support by the UndeadPandemic plugin. This means that you _**do not**_ need to install QualityArmory yourself for the weapons to work.

All of the new config.yml additions have a default value, so if you don't update your config.yml, then this will not break the game.

You will also notice a new number in the versioning, i.e. 2.4.2-43. This new number is the build number and will be updated with each build and help to more accurately identify newer versions.

Please report any issues/bugs using the issues page.
