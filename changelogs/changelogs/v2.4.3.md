# v2.4.3

_**== Weapons Update ==**_

**Please consider this a Weapons **_**BETA**_** version**.

This update will add support for the [QualityArmory plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quality-armory.47561/) found on Spigot. You will be able to use the QualityArmory plugin as normal and you will receive the benefits of killing zombies as you would for UndeadPandemic weapons.

You do not need to change anything in the config to enable QualityArmory. If you have the plugin in your plugins folder then QualityArmory compatibility will be enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Undead Pandemic resource pack has also been updated to include the QualityArmory textures. Copyright of ZombieStriker and QualityArmory. The textures were added to the UndeadPandemic resource pack so that you can enjoy the experience of both texture packs.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Head shots may only count as a normal kill when using QualityArmory weapons.
{% endhint %}

All of the config.yml additions will now have a default value, so that if you don't update your config.yml it will not break the game.

The versioning has been updated.

Please report any issues/bugs using the issues page.
