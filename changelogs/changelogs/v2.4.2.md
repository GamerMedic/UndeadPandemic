# v2.4.2

_**== Zombie Guts Update ==**_

**Please consider this a Zombie Guts&#x20;**_**BETA**_**&#x20;version**.

There may be issues with the zombie guts timer, and issues with zombie guts disappearing in the rain. The gameplay idea behind this update is that zombie guts are essentially rotting flesh, and rotting flesh decomposes over time, and the smell washes off when exposed to water.

Updates in this version include:

1. Added timer to zombie guts
2. Added timer feature to config.yml
3. Added zombie guts drop chance to config.yml
4. Zombie guts break in water and when raining or snowing.
5. Added option to select symptoms of infection in config.yml.
6. Added random kill rewards

All of the new config.yml additions have a default value, so if you don't update your config.yml, then this will not break the game.

You will also notice a new number in the versioning, i.e. 2.4.2-43. This new number is the build number and will be updated with each build and help to more accurately identify newer versions.

Please report any issues/bugs using the issues page.
