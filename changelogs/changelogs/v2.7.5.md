# v2.7.5

_**== Bug Fixes & Updates ==**_

{% hint style="warning" %}
**`config.yml` update recommended, but not required.**
{% endhint %}

Changes to include:

* Removed weapons system. You can no longer use native guns and ammo/
  * The weapons system was removed because there are much better weapons systems on the market and it's far better to utilise these systems. Killing zombies will still drop rewards.
  * Future updates will allow loud weapons to attract zombies again. In the meantime, these `config.yml` settings will not do anything.
* Updated how head shot is calculated when a zombie is killed.
* Fixed NullPointerException error on PlayQuitEvent.
* Fixed bug where the first aid kits do not contain items.
