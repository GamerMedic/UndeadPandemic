# ðŸ‘‘ v3.0.1

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed crafting issues preventing crafting of items not included on the blacklist (thanks to Z3roless for reporting this issue).
* Fixed null pointer error which occurred when when zombies are spawned without armour.
* Fixed null pointer error when checking permissions.
* Fixed errors caused by permission checks (invalid permission even when player has permission).
* Fixed permissions issue where permissions were being checked every time the inventory was clicked.
* Added null checks to zombie armour to prevent potential errors.
* Added blacklisted world checks to camp fires and cauldrons when checking states during rain.

### Features

* Added custom recipes for:
  * Adrenaline
  * Analgesia
  * Antibiotics
  * Batteries
  * Torches
* Added premium feature that allows cauldrons to be filled by rain water. <mark style="color:yellow;">BETA</mark>
  * Cauldrons must be out in the open. It will not fill if there is a block within 16 blocks above it. Anything over 16 blocks can be considered to have wind pushing water in to the cauldrons.
  * Add a new config option under the `camps` section: `fill-containers-in-rain: true`
* Updated camp fire dousing so that it is only doused after the rain starts, instead of immediately when the weather state changes.
  * Also ensured that the usual dousing effects are applied.
* Updated zombie logic to improve door breaking. Iron doors cannot be broken by zombies.
