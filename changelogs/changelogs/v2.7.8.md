# v2.7.8

**== Bug Fixes & Minor Updates ==**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**`config.yml` update recommended, but not required.**
{% endhint %}

Changes include:

* Added infected water system.
  * Updated wiki with relevant information.
* Added infected animals system.
  * Surf & Turf included.
  * If you fish up an infected fish the fishing rod will stick. This is a known bug and is being worked on. All that's needed to progress is to `right click` at least twice.
* The `undeadpandemic.immune` permission has been set to `false` by default. This means that admins can be infected unless they are specifically given this permission.
* Added `use_whitelist` option to `config.yml`. Setting this option to `true` will turn `disable_in_worlds` into a whitelist instead of blacklist.
* `EntityDamageByEntityEvent` bug fixed.
* `NullPointerException` bug fixed.
