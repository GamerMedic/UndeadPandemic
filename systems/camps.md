# üèï Camps

### What is a Camp?

Camps (formerly called Safe Zones) are a collection of plots where Zombies will not spawn.

#### What are plots?

Plots are equal to one Minecraft chunk (x1 16x16 block extending from Bedrock to the Ceiling (build limit).

### How do Camps work?

Players can build a camp by building a plot, or a collection of plots adjacent to each other, which is achieved by using the [`safezone:build` command](../commands/safezone/build.md).

A Camp does not allow Zombies to spawn within its borders.&#x20;

Other players cannot destroy blocks that are protected by Camps.

Camps can be dismantled by using the [safezone:destroy command](../commands/safezone/destroy.md).

### How do you get plots?

Players with admin permissions can use the[ safezone:plots command](../commands/safezone/plots.md) to give or take plots to and from players.

Server admins can also choose to give plots in other ways, as rewards, or as token currency. This is recommended, but at the discretion of admins.

[CraftBook](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/craftbook.2083/) is recommended to use plots as tokens.

### Are plots protected from players?

In older versions of the plugin, you will need to change the flags in the `config.yml` file. The newest version will prevent other players from opening doors, however, chests are not protected by default.

### Cautions

It's best not to use Camps if you are using a plugin such as Towny or Factions, because the plot protection may conflict with those plugins. The Camps feature is designed to be used as a standalone plot protection system so its use it optional when using other protection plugins.
