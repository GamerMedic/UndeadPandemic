# ðŸ’Š Health System

This page will take effect from v2.6.0. Information on existing systems will not be included on this page until v2.6.0 is released.

### What is the Health System?

The health system encompasses the following variables:

* [Thirst](thirst-system.md)
* Illness / Injury

### Health Status

The health status is the players' current level of health. This will either be '<mark style="color:green;">Healthy</mark>' or '<mark style="color:red;">Unhealthy</mark>'. If the player is unhealthy, then the status will display one of the health conditions listed below.

If the health status is unhealthy then the player will have potion effects applied based on the health condition. Some of these effects can be customised, but the default effects are listed below.

### Thirst

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please refer to the [thirst system](../thirst-system-legacy.md) if you are using any version pre-v2.6.0.
{% endhint %}

The thirst system works largely in the same way as it did before, except the players thirst can be displayed in a boss bar or using PAPI placeholders instead of the XP bar.

Previously, player effects were applied based on the level of thirst. From v2.6.0 effects will instead be applied based on the player's health status.
