### What is the Health System?

The health system encompasses the following variables:

* [Thirst](thirst-system.md)
* Illness / Injury

### Health Status

The health status is the players' current level of health. This will either be '<mark style="color:green;">Healthy</mark>' or '<mark style="color:red;">Unhealthy</mark>'. If the player is unhealthy, then the status will display one of the health conditions listed below.

If the health status is unhealthy then the player will have potion effects applied based on the health condition. Some of these effects can be customised, but the default effects are listed below.
