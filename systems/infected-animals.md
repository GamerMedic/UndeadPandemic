{% embed url="https://youtu.be/XP-cFgnUrQw" %}

### What happens?

When you kill an animal there will be a percentage chance that it will drop [`Rotten Flesh`](../items/rotten-flesh.md) instead of the usual meat.

### Identifying Infected Animals

There is no way to check if an animal is infected until it drops [Rotten Flesh](../items/rotten-flesh.md).

### Modifying Infected Animals

The chance that an animal will dropped infected meat is configurable in the `config.yml` file.
