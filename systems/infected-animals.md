# 🐄 Infected Animals

{% hint style="danger" %}
Not yet implemented (as of v2.7.5).
{% endhint %}

### What happens?

When you kill an animal there will be a percentage chance (modifiable through the `config.yml` file) that it will drop [`Rotten Flesh`](../items/rotten-flesh.md) instead of the usual meat.
