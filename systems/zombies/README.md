# Zombies

You can add an unlimited number of different zombie types.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can enable and disable zombie types in the config. The plugin will default to using vanilla zombies if all zombies are disabled.
{% endhint %}

### Creating a New Type

To create a new type of zombie you just need to [add the configuration settings in config.yml](../../configuration/config.yml/zombie-settings.md).

### Hordes

So, a lot of work has gone into organising hordes to make gameplay that much more challenging. Before the v2.5.0 update horde technology largely relied on spawn rates which meant that hordes were common.

In the v2.5.0 update hordes are more orchestrated and more aggressively attack players, no matter what type of zombie. Zombie types in hordes will generate as per the odds set in the config.yml file.
