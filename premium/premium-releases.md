### Platform

Due to Spigot restrictions it is unlikely that the premium release will be available on SpigotMC. Other platforms will be researched. There is also the possibility that the premium version will be self-hosted.

### I've already donated to SteveZR963, will I have to pay for the premium version as well?

No. SteveZR963 will personally send you a copy of the Premium version over Discord (or elsewhere if you're not on Discord).

You'll be also be given information on how to access premium version updates.
