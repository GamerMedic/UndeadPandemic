# ðŸš± Contaminated Water

### What is contaminated water?

When you fill a container with water from a body of water (i.e. river, ocean, lake, ect) you will get `Contaminated Water`.

If the player drinks contaminated water they will become infected.

### How to get drinkable water?

Place a campfire under a cauldron and fill the cauldron with water. Then collect water from the cauldron as normal.

#### Future Updates

Filtered cauldrons will be introduced in the future. Water will only be able to be filtered and cleaned in a filtered cauldron.
